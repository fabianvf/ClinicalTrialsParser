The multicenter trial is composed of two phases and will\n      involve a double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel design. The goal of Phase I is to\n      examine the ability of nifedipine vs. placebo to decrease adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)\n      levels, as well as to begin to assess the dose-dependency of nifedipine effects.  The goal\n      of Phase II is to evaluate the long-term effects of nifedipine; that is, can attenuation of\n      ACTH release by nifedipine permit a decrease in the dosage of glucocorticoid needed to\n      suppress the HPA axis?  Such a decrease would, in turn, reduce the deleterious effects of\n      glucocorticoid treatment in CAH."
